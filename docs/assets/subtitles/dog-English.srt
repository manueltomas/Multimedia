00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
You have found a dog! 

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,700
The dog, known as Canis familiaris, is a very common species around residential areas. 

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:13,890
The reason for this is that they are a domestic species,

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,900
that is, a species of animal where humans have exerted immense influence over their livelihood

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,060
and care over multiple generations, such that the species develops

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,730
enabling traits that make them rely more on humans and enhance their social characteristics.

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,340
Dogs were first domesticated in Europe, the area around modern-day Germany, 

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,110
with the process starting at least 14000 years ago. 

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:49,080
However, disputed sources point to other, older possibilities, such as Eurasia.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,970
Whatever the case, the dog is recognised as the first animal species to be domesticated.

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,960
This long association with humans is due to the symbiotic relationship between the two species.

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,270
The nearest living relative of the modern day dog are the species of grey wolf.

13
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:16,670
They are valued for their plethora of roles, from simple companionship to hunting, herding and other tasks assisting humans.

14
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,730
As of 2013 there are an estimated 700 million dogs, or up to 987 million, in the world.

15
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:32,700
However, only around 20% of this number truly live in human homes, with the rest remaining feral or communally owned.
