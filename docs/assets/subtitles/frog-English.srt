00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
You have found a frog! 

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:11,680
The frog, known as Anura, is an amphibian species common in the wild all over all the continents in the world.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,920
Different species of frogs can be found in different environments, from tropical to subarctic regions.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,720
However, the majority of species reside in tropical rainforests.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:36,800
Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, and not scientific.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,170
The oldest fossil of a species from the frog lineage that is known was found in Madagascar, and is dated to 250 million years ago, 

7
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,850
with certain techniques indicating up to 265 million years ago instead. 

8
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,570
Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. 

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,580
More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction,

10
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:15,010
and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s.

11
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:24,820
The causes are difficult to determine, but it is believed that species such as frogs, which have a presence both in water and land,

12
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:34,100
possess sensitive skin and an intermediate role in the food chain, make for good indicators of an ecosystem’s health.

13
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:42,690
Furthermore, infectious diseases have since begun spreading amongst frogs, contributing to the given decline.
