00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
You have found a boar! 

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:12,900
The boar, known as Sus scrofa, is a species common in the wild all over Eurasia, North Africa, Australia and the Americas.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:20,770
They are suidae, the family to which hogs, pigs and boars all belong to, and in particular,

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,040
they are the most widespread species from this family.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:33,180
The boar has been accessed as Least Concern, meaning they are not in any danger of extinction or even scarcity, 

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,680
due to their high numbers and adaptability to a variety of different habitats.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,990
So much so that it is considered an invasive species in many areas.

8
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,150
It is speculated that the Wild Boars may have originated in Southeast Asia, hundreds of thousands of years ago,

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,530
having spread throughout Europe, Asia and Africa and triumphing over their competitors.

10
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:06,740
The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of related females and their young, regardless of gender.

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,250
Fully grown males go on to become solitary outside of their breeding season.

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,500
In most of its natural habitats, their main competitor is the grey wolf.

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,940
The wild boar has a long history of association with humans, and indeed

14
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,460
is the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and traditional hunting quarry for millennia.
