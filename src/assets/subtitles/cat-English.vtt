You have found a cat!

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.200
The cat, known as Felis catus, is a very common species around residential areas.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.510
The reason for this is that they are a domestic species, that is,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.500
a species of animal where humans have exerted immense influence over their livelihood

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.690
and care over multiple generations,

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.710
such that the species develops enabling traits that make them rely more on humans

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.710
and enhance their social characteristics.

8
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.910
Cats were first domesticated in the Middle East,

9
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.100
the area around modern-day Turkey, Egypt, and Western Asia,

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.300
with the process starting at least 9500 years ago.

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.100
The modern cat is specifically denoted as domestic due to the prevalence of wild cats,

12
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.700
and indeed, the domestic cat is the only member of the Felidae family that has been domesticated.

13
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.100
They are valued for both their companionship and their roles hunting rodents, for example aboard ships.

14
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:11.500
As of 2021 there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.
