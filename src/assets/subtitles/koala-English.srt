00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
You have found a koala! 

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:12,010
The koala, known as Phascolarctos cinereus, is naturally not a species common over here.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,950
In truth, koala’s are exclusively native to Australia,

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,870
leading this animal species to become eponymous with the continent.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:32,110
Koala’s are arboreal herbivores, that is, a species of animal that has adapted to eating solely plant material, 

6
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:38,280
and which has evolved to move among trees. They are an asocial species, 

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,420
meaning the members of the species do not regularly remain in contact,

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,650
the exception being mothers and their still dependent offspring.

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:56,010
There is a visible distinction in koala populations between the north and south of Australia,

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,490
but there is debate on whether these constitute different subspecies.

11
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:07,380
Historically, the koala was only introduced to Europe recently,

12
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:15,070
with the first recorded encounter of a koala by a European being dated to 1798,

13
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,940
with illustration and scientific descriptions following within the following century.

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:31,090
Population estimates for the Koala are similarly disputed, and efforts to detect and count koalas are difficult 

15
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,340
as they remain hidden from potential predators such as humans.

16
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,520
The species is, however, considered Vulnerable.
