00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
You have found a fox!

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.640
The fox, consisting of many species part of the Vulpes genus,

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.190
is a group of omnivorous animals native to all continents except Antarctica.

4
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.620
As omnivores, the foxes are capable of adapting to a variety of habitats,

5
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.800
and indeed they are one of the few species of animals that can adapt to living in urban environments to some extent.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.030
The name of the fox in a variety of languages tends to originate in their looks,

7
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.450
often being a reference to their tails or their bushiness.

8
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.530
The fox is a popular figure in human culture, often standing as a symbol of cunning and trickery,

9
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.880
due to their historic ability to evade hunters and opportunistically target prey.

10
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.250
In Asian countries they are furthermore depicted as familiar spirits possessing their own magic.

11
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:12.520
Known as nine-tailed foxes, these shapeshifting creatures would have a propensity for tricking humans and,

12
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.050
with their ability to disguise themselves, could be either a good or bad omen.

13
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:29.010
Foxes are unsuited to long-term domestication. They develop an instinctual fear of humans other than their caretakers,

14
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.810
and retain the desire to destroy leather objects or attack other small animals for consumption.

15
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.730
A number of fox species are considered to be of least concern as far as their population goes, but similarly,

16
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:54.650
a number of other species are considered endangered, due to only residing in specific habitats affected by habitat loss.

17
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.300
